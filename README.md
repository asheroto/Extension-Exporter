# Extension Exporter

Extension Exporter is a Chrome extension designed to export the names and URLs of all your installed extensions into an HTML file. This extension is fully open-source to ensure transparency and safety.

## Stores

Available on both the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/extension-exporter/doikmfpjbcjjimnbablebijofdbgfepb) and [Microsoft Edge-Addons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/extension-exporter/oejmelcbffojcocoodfdkkmmidolpeoo).

## Features

- **Export Installed Extensions**: Organize installed extension names and homepage URLs into an offline HTML file (no dependencies).
- **Local Execution**: All code runs locally without connecting to remote servers.
- **Easy-to-use**: Click the extension button to instantly generate the HTML file.
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Currently functions on both Chrome and Edge browsers.
- **Separate Enabled and Disabled Extensions**: Clearly distinguish between enabled and disabled extensions.
- [(Removed - see below)](#feature-removal) **CRX Download Links**: Includes download links (CRX) for each extension.
- **Text-only Listing**: Offers a text-based listing with both copy-to-clipboard functionality and a print option.
- [(Removed soon - see below)](#feature-removal) **Toggle CRX Download**: Easily toggle visibility of CRX download icons.
- **Toggle Stats**: View extension stats using [Chrome-Stats.com](https://chrome-stats.com/) or [Edge-Stats.com](https://edge-stats.com/). These sites provide statistics on the usage, popularity, and ratings of Chrome and Edge extensions, aiding users in assessing their reliability and performance.
- **Toggle CRXcavator Report**: Access [CRXcavator](https://crxcavator.io/) reports for extensions, providing detailed security assessments, including information on the remote servers to which the extension connects, to evaluate the security risks associated with browser extensions.

## Installation

This extension is available on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/extension-exporter/doikmfpjbcjjimnbablebijofdbgfepb). This is the recommended installation approach. Alternatively, you can install the CRX file in releases.

## Open Source

This extension is fully open-source to ensure both transparency and security. You can view and even contribute to the source code.

## Feature Removal  

Some features have been **removed** or will be removed soon due to Chrome security changes.  

- **CRX Download Links** – No longer functional due to browser restrictions. Use the CRX link from the text-only listing with `wget`, `curl`, or the [CRX Extractor/Downloader](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/crx-extractordownloader/ajkhmmldknmfjnmeedkbkkojgobmljda) extension.  
- **Toggle CRX Download** – Will be removed as CRX downloads no longer work from the exported HTML file.  

Chrome now blocks direct CRX downloads from external HTML files for security reasons. **Manually installed CRX files also won't update automatically**, so we recommend installing from the **Chrome Web Store** or **Edge Add-ons Store** for updates and security patches.
